# Bird Starter Pack

*Front End Starter pack using Vite and npm/nvm*

## What Worked Well
Overall, following the directions for installing vite, as well as all the config files was straightforward. Applying some basic styling to the page was almost automatic as well.

## What Didn't
Nothing was particularly troublesome, thought it took some time to find the correct vite compatible favicon tool and to update node from v18 (it refused to upgrade ven after uninstall/reinstall)

## Extra Credit
* favicon generator
* using NVM
