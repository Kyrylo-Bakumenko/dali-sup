## What Worked Well

Working through part 1 seemed pretty fine. I seemed to gloss over ht epart that Z-index was EC, as it bugged me the way notes overlapped I fixed it as part of part-1.

## What Didn't

Firebase. I don't know how but for the first 5 times I went through the steps I had everything but databaseURL. Then it fixed; weird.

## Extra Credit

Z-index sorting.
